## TinyTask 


TinyTask is a utility software created by Vista Software. It's incredibly helpful, and what's better is that it's completely free! It allows users quick and easy access to automating playback and recording. 
Whether you're wanting to prank a friend or create an .exe, TinyTask is a great choice. 
This isn't about audio, though. So what is it, then? It's a mouse and keyboard macro recorder. This means that everything you type and all you do with your mouse while the program is active can be replayed. This can be done as many times as you'd like. 
You can even make them into .exe files! 


### Features of TinyTask

TinyTask is a minimalist and tiny (35 KB) keyboard macro recording and playback tool. Itâ€™s used to automatically control the mouse and keyboard actions, so as to complete repeated computer operations. Anything you do with the mouse or type on the keyboard while the program is running can be replayed as many times as you choose. It not only records and saves macros but also compiles them, turning your recorded macros into executable programs.

There's no installer, help file, or anything unnecessary; just a tiny EXE program, which doesn't touch your registry or change your system folders.
